LIRI

Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

If you want to clone this app to run yourself, you will need to create a .env file to hold your API keys. This file will be used by the dotenv package to set environment variables to the global process.env object in node. Enter the following code into your .env file:

# Spotify API Keys
SPOTIFY_ID=your-spotify-id
SPOTIFY_SECRET=your-spotify-secret
